Through this project, I practiced:
✅ Data cleaning & preparation
✅ Pivot tables and pivot charts
✅ KPI cards design
✅ Interactive slicers (Month & Year filter)

Building this helped me better understand how data can support healthcare decision-making and improve operational efficiency.

I’m continuing to improve my data analytics and dashboard development skills.
Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
